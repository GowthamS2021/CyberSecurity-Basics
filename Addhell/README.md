# add-hell

This challenge is about modern crypotgraphy especially about diffie hellman key encryption process.

It is a challenge in [module-2 part-c repo]( https://github.com/CSecIITB/module-2-c-more-about-modern-crpytography-GowthamS2021/tree/main/Challenges/add-hell ).

I have reversed the entire process of the diffie hellman scheme since all the data about the prime numbers and other were given in the data.txt(data.txt is available in the linked repository itself)
, using solution.py

we can get the flag as YoS{4dd1t1v3_gr0up_15_h34v3n!!!}.
