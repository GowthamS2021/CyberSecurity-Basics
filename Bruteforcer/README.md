# Bruteforcer

This is the solution for the question in [module 1 part 2 python](https://github.com/CSecIITB/module-1-python-GowthamS2021/tree/main/bruteforcer).
I have used python file script.py with a bash file called script.py which i have put in this folder, running this file in the same folder as the wordlist.txt and
Bruteforcer exceutable, the output can be used to get the final flag hidden in this question.
